=head2 Rex::IO::Server

This is the Server Component of Rex. This component is for collecting multiple backends under one middleware to get a consistent api to talk to the backends (like CMDBs, DHCP, DNS, Issue/Incident Trackers, and more).

It also provides bare metal deployment capabilities.

This is a work in progress project.
