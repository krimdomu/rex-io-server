=head2 Rex::IO::Server

This is the Server Component of Rex. This component is for collecting multiple backends under one middleware to get a consistent api to talk to the backends (like CMDBs, Issue/Incident Trackers, and more).

This is a work in progress project.

=head2 INSTALLATION

First you have to install Mojolicious. You can download it from CPAN or from L<http://mojolicio.us>.

Than you need to setup Rex::IO::CMDB L<https://github.com/krimdomu/rex-io-cmdb>.

After that, you can setup Rex::IO::Server.

 git clone git://github.com/krimdomu/rex-io-server.git
 cd rex-io-server

Now edit the file I<server.conf>. And set the url to Rex::IO::CMDB.

And start the server:

 script/rex_ioserver daemon

You can also define an other Listen Port (default is 3000)

 script/rex_ioserver daemon -l 'http://:4000'

Right now there is no Webinterface. You can test if everything is correct with the following command:

 curl -X LIST http://localhost:3000/servero

If you get an answer like this it works:

 {"ok":true,"data":{}}
